  In this task, we will create a machine learning model that will classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "non-spam". A "non-spam" message is a normal message sent by a friend. A "spam" message is an advertisement or a message sent by a company..
  We need to create a function called preprocess_text that takes a message string as an argument and returns a lowercase string. Then removes the special characters and white spaces.Then return the text and another function predict_spam_percentage will find what percentage of the returned message string is spam.
  For this challenge, you will use the SMS Spam Collection dataset. The dataset has been grouped into train data and test data.
